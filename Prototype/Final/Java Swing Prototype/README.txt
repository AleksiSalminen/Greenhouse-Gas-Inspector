Java Swing Prototype
--------------------

There are two executables included in the folder:

- A basic Windows executable (the Exe-file)

- A Java executable (the Jar-file)
  * Running the Jar-file requires Java to be installed

The "src"-folder contains the images the application uses.
Don't delete it or move it.
